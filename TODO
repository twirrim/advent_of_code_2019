Change immediate / position mode to use an enum

Can I modify OC::Input and OC::Output so that it would be possible to write tests for them?
Update OC::Add and OC::Mul tests to account for immediate and position mode

See if there is a way to make RangeInclusive work with PrimInt? Currently vm.get_memory_range only accepts usize ranges.  Ugly thought: worst case scenario I'd shift to `get_memory_range(start, end)` style input
