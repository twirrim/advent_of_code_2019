Can I modify OC::Input and OC::Output so that it would be possible to write tests for them?
Update OC::Add and OC::Mul tests to account for immediate and position mode

Not sure this is an issue, but maybe see if there is a way to make RangeInclusive work with PrimInt? Currently vm.get_memory_range only accepts usize ranges?
So far the only thing it's being used for is to get the parameters and that's a fixed range off the current pointer, all usize.
Ugly thought: worst case scenario I'd shift to `get_memory_range(start, end)` style input
